Xtrabytes - The Proof of Signature Blockchain Database

Xtrabytes is a newly invented blockchain infrastructure that does not require any traditional type of mining support, such as: POW or POS. We have created something called Proof of Signature which ensures that 100% of all blocks will be signed by the system when they occur. The blocks are signed by the network of Master Nodes after verifying the transactions in the block. There are a total of 650 million XBY and there will never be more. 

At the backbone of the Xtrabytes system is a shared database storage system that will never be prone to forks or consensus attacks. Our unique consensus algorithm allows for verification without miners or other inefficient verification processes.

### More Information

At this time the vast majority of the code is closed source and under patent review. This repository is by no means representative of the full Xtrabytes software. 

Currently the Xtrabytes frontend development is non-proprietary and can be actively viewed at https://github.com/borzalom/xcite
